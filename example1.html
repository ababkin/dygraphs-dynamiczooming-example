      <h3>Using Dygraphs to dynamically load down-sampled data
        <small> - Example 1</small>
      </h3>

      <p>In the example below, new data is loaded from a simulated server when the user zooms in on the graph.
        This provides an overall view of the entire possible data set via the range selector below the graph, but allows
        interactive drill down in to more detailed views of the data without having to load the entire data set at the
        start. For very large data sets, loading all the data from the start is not practical.</p>

      <p>The shaded areas above and below the solid line indicate min/max values whenever the data is being
        down-sampled, and in this case, the solid line indicates the average value at that time. As the user zooms in,
        eventually there are no min/max indicators because they are looking at the actual data value.</p>

      <h3>How it works</h3>

      <p>
        When the page loads, <strong>two data requests are sent to the server. One for the "range" data, and one for the
        "detail" data.</strong>. In this example, the page always initializes such that range and detail data sets are
        exactly the same. (This could eventually be optimized out because the detail loads are redundant when
        they reflect the same date window and down-sampling intervals as the range loads.) <strong>When zooming,
        a new request is made for more detailed data according to the new zoom extents</strong> (or "dateWindow" in
        Dygraphs terminology.)
      </p>

      <p>
        When the new detail data is received, the code in <strong>GraphDataProvider.js then splices it with the existing
        range data set to generate a single new "spliced data set"</strong>. This spliced data set is what is given to
        Dygraphs for drawing. This allows Dygraphs to draw and support the range selector control, but draw the more
        detailed data in the zoom window currently being viewed. The non-zoomed (aka more-downsampled) data can be seen
        while dragging the range selector because the code <strong>does not initiate a new detail data load until
        mouse-up</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <strong>main caveat with this approach is related to the different ways the zoom window (dateWindow) can be
        changed in Dygraphs</strong> and the different results with each interaction. The dateWindow can be changed
        with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A - Dragging on the range selector handles - Causes multiple zoomCallbacks while the position of the handle
          is changing
        </li>
        <li>B - Dragging the range selector to move the dateWindow - No zoomCallback</li>
        <li>C - Click-dragging on the graph to zoom - Causes a single zoomCallback</li>
        <li>D - Click-dragging while holding Shift to pan - No zoomCallback, and not handled in this demo. Handling this
          requires additional complexity that I'll show in a future example.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>To handle these interactions, the code installs a mouse-down and subsequent mouse-up listener on the
          range selector.</strong> (It also installs corresponding touch event listeners so this works on tablets.) When a mouse
        down occurs on the range selector, the code tracks it and ignores all subsequent zoomCallbacks. This handles
        (A). We initiate the data load on mouse-up. This handles (A) and (B). If there was no mouse-down on the range
        selector and we get a zoomCallback, then we assume (C), and so initiate an immediate data load. Handling (D)
        requires hooking in to the drawCallback and is not shown in this example.
      </p>

      <p>That's basically it. <strong>The code, and comments in the code, show the details.</strong></p>

      <h4>A note on third party libraries</h4>

      <p>
        I used jQuery because it simplifies the code and, honestly, I've probably started forgetting how to work with
        DOM events correctly without it. I also used two other third party libraries that are not required, but
        made this example a little better. Both could be easily removed (and I might do so at some point so as not
        to confuse the dygraphs portion of all of this.) The two extra libraries:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://momentjs.com/">moment.js</a> - makes working with JavaScript dates so much better.</li>
        <li><a href="http://fgnass.github.io/spin.js/">spin.js</a> - used to indicate when data is being loaded. A
          simple "data loading..." message would also work. It's too bad <a
              href="http://www.webmonkey.com/2013/04/its-the-end-of-the-blink-tag-as-we-know-it/">firefox removed the
            blink tag</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Both libraries could be very quickly extracted from this example as they are only used in few places.
